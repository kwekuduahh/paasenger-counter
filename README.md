## My process

1. I gathered the design assets on my Figma board.
2. Designed the interface on Figma.
3. Proceeded to initialize a git repo and connect the repo.
4. I created a working branch to ensure that changes are well tracked and prevent errors from the main branch.
5. Then, I started writing the code to the working branch.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Clamp

### What I learned

I learnt how to make good use of css flexbox and clamp() to make responsive layouts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="image-overlay">
	<img
		src="images/icon-view.svg"
		alt="icon-view"
	/>
</div>
```

```css
.image-overlay {
	position: absolute;
	opacity: 0;
	background-color: var(--Cyan);
	width: clamp(304px, 90%, 314px);
	height: clamp(304px, 90%, 314px);
	border-radius: 10px;
	transform: translate(0%, -100%);
	transition: 0.5s ease;
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

### Continued development

I will keep exploring creating responsive and reusable code in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) - This helped me with css clamp() and the hover effect on the image.
